# three-pinata

Three.js library for fracturing and slicing non-convex meshes in real time.

This is a Typescript port of the [OpenFracture](https://github.com/dgreenheck/OpenFracture) library I wrote for Unity several years ago.

The demo app utilizes [Rapier](https://www.rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/javascript/getting_started_js) for the collision detection and physics.

# How to Run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
